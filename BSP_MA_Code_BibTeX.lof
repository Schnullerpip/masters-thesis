Note that the vertical axis must be on a logarithmic scale to record the size of the processor-DRAM performance gap. The memory baseline is 64 KB DRAM in 1980, with a 1.07 per year performance improvement in latency (see Figure 5.13 on page 313). The processor line assumes a 1.25 improvement per year until 1986, and a 1.52 improvement until 2004, and a 1.20 improvement thereafter}" (Source: \cite [p. 289]{hennessy})\relax }}{5}{figure.caption.8}%
