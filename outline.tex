\outline{This work will prospect the possibility of using compiler technology as a mediator between the conflicting programming paradigms/philosophies \textit{OOP} and \textit{DoD}.\\
While Object-oriented programming is often praised for its benefits on abstraction and maintainability, it encourages programmers to design inefficient datalayouts. Specifically in game engineering, where performance is a constitutive factor for a product's success, data oriented solutions and influences are on the rise. While it is debated, whether or not performant data layouts inevitably entail challenging maintenance, surely the base concepts of \textit{objects} are well observable in a game. Therefore this will be an attempt to make object-oriented programming a valid option for ever rising demands on performance.\\
To do so this thesis will investigate key concepts of both paradigms, as well as hardware specifics in modern computer architectures to explicate the reasons for their good/bad interaction with the hardware.\\
A prototypical implementation of a source-to-source transformation tool called \textit{COOP} (\textbf{C}ache friendly \textbf{O}bject \textbf{O}riented \textbf{P}rogramming), developed in Clang's LibTooling environment, will determine whether or not compiler technology can be used to achieve a performance optimization on a classically OOP abidant target code base.}
